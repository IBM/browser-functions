# Performance benchmarks

Due to the lightweight nature of browser tabs, using them as containers provides a significant performance boost over traditional serverless architectures, such as those that use Docker or similar containers. 

Below are the benchmark results of running a function on Browser Functions, vs running on Apache OpenWhisk, on the same hardware (MacBook Pro 2015). This is a baseline comparative test, running a trivial JavaScript function on the two platforms. Other tests with different workload or test profiles may reveal different performance results. Apache OpenWhisk was installed using [this method](https://github.com/apache/openwhisk#quick-start), a production installation may perform differently. The blue line (braas) represents the performance of Browser Functions, vs the orange line for Apache OpenWhisk.

# Web Assembly native code execution

The following function for calculating the Fibonacci sequence was compiled to a native binary (using `gcc` with default settings), and to Web Assembly using `emscripten`, and compared against a JavaScript implementation:

```c
int fib (int n) {
  if (n < 2) {
    return 1;
  }
  return fib(n - 2) + fib(n - 1);
}
```

Benchmark results for running `fib(42)` on a MacBook Pro 2015:

| Implementation| Execution time |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| JavaScript    | 5.778 seconds |
| GCC binary    | 1.746 seconds |
| Web Assembly via Browser Functions | 1.564 seconds |

Note that the Web Assembly version running through Browser Functions is faster than running the natively compiled binary from the command line!

# GPU acceleration with WebGL

It is possible to utilize GPU hardware acceleration by making use of WebGL. Some JavaScript libraries already do this, for example [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js/) or [GPU.js](https://gpu.rocks/). Below is a comparison of multiplying two 512 x 512 matricies using CPU vs using GPU via WebGL:
