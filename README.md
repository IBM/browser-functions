# Browser Functions

Browser Functions is a platform for running functions written using the Web API, on a server. Any code executable by a modern browser, such as HTML, JavaScript, CSS, or even WebAssembly, can be executed inside Browser Functions. The functions are actually executed within a browser on the server (e.g. Chrome or Firefox). This means that front-end code can be used directly in the backend.

## Documentation and examples

You can view the [documentation](docs/index.md) describing how to install, manage and use Browser Functions, and also view [examples](/functions_root/examples/files) of functions that can be executed on the platform.
